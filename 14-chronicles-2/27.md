## Jotham’s Reign

<a name="27:1">27:1</a> Jotham was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jerusha the daughter of Zadok. <a name="27:2">27:2</a> He did what the Lord approved, just as his father Uzziah had done. (He did not, however, have the audacity to enter the temple.) Yet the people were still sinning.

<a name="27:3">27:3</a> He built the Upper Gate to the Lord’s temple and did a lot of work on the wall on the hill. <a name="27:4">27:4</a> He built cities in the hill country of Judah and fortresses and towers in the forests.

<a name="27:5">27:5</a> He launched a military campaign against the king of the Ammonites and defeated them. That year the Ammonites paid him a hundred units of silver, ten thousand kors of wheat, and ten thousand kors of barley. The Ammonites also paid this same amount of annual tribute the next two years.

<a name="27:6">27:6</a> Jotham grew powerful because he was determined to please the Lord his God. <a name="27:7">27:7</a> The rest of the events of Jotham’s reign, including all his military campaigns and his accomplishments, are recorded in the scroll of the kings of Israel and Judah. <a name="27:8">27:8</a> He was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. <a name="27:9">27:9</a> Jotham passed away and was buried in the City of David. His son Ahaz replaced him as king.
