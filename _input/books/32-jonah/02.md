<a name="2:1">2:1</a> Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from the stomach of the fish <a>2:2</a> a> and said,

“I called out to the LORD from my distress,
and he answered me;
from the belly of Sheol I cried out for help,
and you heard my prayer.

<a name="2:3">2:3</a> You cast me into the deep waters,
into the middle of the sea;
the ocean current engulfed me;
all the mighty waves you sent swept over me.

<a name="2:4">2:4</a> I thought I had been banished from your sight,
that I would never again see your holy temple!

<a name="2:5">2:5</a> Water engulfed me up to my neck;
the deep ocean surrounded me;
seaweed was wrapped around my head.

<a name="2:6">2:6</a> I went down to the bottoms of the mountains;
the gates of the netherworld barred me in forever;
but you brought me up from the Pit, O Lord, my God.

<a name="2:7">2:7</a> When my life was ebbing away, I called out to the Lord,
and my prayer came to your holy temple.

<a name="2:8">2:8</a> Those who worship worthless idols forfeit the mercy that could be theirs.

<a name="2:9">2:9</a> But as for me, I promise to offer a sacrifice to you with a public declaration of praise;
I will surely do what I have promised.
Salvation belongs to the Lord!”

<a name="2:10">2:10</a> Then the Lord commanded the fish and it disgorged Jonah on dry land.
