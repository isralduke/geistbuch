A song of ascents.


<a name="121:1">121:1</a> I look up toward the hills.
From where does my help come?

<a name="121:2">121:2</a> My help comes from the Lord,
the Creator of heaven and earth!

<a name="121:3">121:3</a> May he not allow your foot to slip!
May your protector not sleep!

<a name="121:4">121:4</a> Look! Israelâ€™s protector
does not sleep or slumber!

<a name="121:5">121:5</a> The Lord is your protector;
the Lord is the shade at your right hand.

<a name="121:6">121:6</a> The sun will not harm you by day,
or the moon by night.

<a name="121:7">121:7</a> The Lord will protect you from all harm;
he will protect your life.

<a name="121:8">121:8</a> The Lord will protect you in all you do,
now and forevermore.
