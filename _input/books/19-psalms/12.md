For the music director; according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David.

<a name="12:1">12:1</a> Deliver, Lord!
For the godly have disappeared;
people of integrity have vanished.

<a name="12:2">12:2</a> People lie to one another;
they flatter and deceive.

<a name="12:3">12:3</a> May the Lord cut off all flattering lips,
and the tongue that boasts!

<a name="12:4">12:4</a> They say, “We speak persuasively;
we know how to flatter and boast.
Who is our master?”

<a name="12:5">12:5</a> “Because of the violence done to the oppressed,
because of the painful cries of the needy,
I will spring into action,” says the Lord.
“I will provide the safety they so desperately desire.”

<a name="12:6">12:6</a> The Lord’s words are absolutely reliable.
They are as untainted as silver purified in a furnace on the ground,
where it is thoroughly refined.

<a name="12:7">12:7</a> You, Lord, will protect them;
you will continually shelter each one from these evil people,

<a name="12:8">12:8</a> for the wicked seem to be everywhere,
when people promote evil.
