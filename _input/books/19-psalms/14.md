For the music director; by David.

<a name="14:1">14:1</a> Fools say to themselves, “There is no God.”
They sin and commit evil deeds;
none of them does what is right.

<a name="14:2">14:2</a> The Lord looks down from heaven at the human race,
to see if there is anyone who is wise and seeks God.

<a name="14:3">14:3</a> Everyone rejects God;
they are all morally corrupt.
None of them does what is right,
not even one!

<a name="14:4">14:4</a> All those who behave wickedly do not understand — 
those who devour my people as if they were eating bread,
and do not call out to the Lord.

<a name="14:5">14:5</a> They are absolutely terrified,
for God defends the godly.

<a name="14:6">14:6</a> You want to humiliate the oppressed,
even though the Lord is their shelter.

<a name="14:7">14:7</a> I wish the deliverance of Israel would come from Zion!
When the Lord restores the well-being of his people,
may Jacob rejoice,
may Israel be happy!
