<a name="112:1">112:1</a> Praise the Lord!
How happy is the one who obeys the Lord,
who takes great delight in keeping his commands.

<a name="112:2">112:2</a> His descendants will be powerful on the earth;
the godly will be blessed.

<a name="112:3">112:3</a> His house contains wealth and riches;
his integrity endures.

<a name="112:4">112:4</a> In the darkness a light shines for the godly,
for each one who is merciful, compassionate, and just.

<a name="112:5">112:5</a> It goes well for the one who generously lends money,
and conducts his business honestly.

<a name="112:6">112:6</a> For he will never be upended;
others will always remember one who is just.

<a name="112:7">112:7</a> He does not fear bad news.
He is confident; he trusts in the Lord.

<a name="112:8">112:8</a> His resolve is firm; he will not succumb to fear
before he looks in triumph on his enemies.

<a name="112:9">112:9</a> He generously gives to the needy;
his integrity endures.
He will be vindicated and honored.

<a name="112:10">112:10</a> When the wicked see this, they will worry;
they will grind their teeth in frustration and melt away;
the desire of the wicked will perish.
