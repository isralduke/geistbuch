A prayer of David.

<a name="16:1">16:1</a> Protect me, O God, for I have taken shelter in you.

<a name="16:2">16:2</a> I say to the Lord, “You are the sovereign Master,
my only source of well-being.”

<a name="16:3">16:3</a> As for God’s chosen people who are in the land,
and the leading officials I admired so much — 

<a name="16:4">16:4</a> their troubles multiply,
they desire other gods.
I will not pour out drink offerings of blood to their gods,
nor will I make vows in the name of their gods.

<a name="16:5">16:5</a> Lord, you give me stability and prosperity;
you make my future secure.

<a name="16:6">16:6</a> It is as if I have been given fertile fields
or received a beautiful tract of land.

<a name="16:7">16:7</a> I will praise the Lord who guides me;
yes, during the night I reflect and learn.

<a name="16:8">16:8</a> I constantly trust in the Lord;
because he is at my right hand, I will not be upended.

<a name="16:9">16:9</a> So my heart rejoices
and I am happy;
My life is safe.

<a name="16:10">16:10</a> You will not abandon me to Sheol;
you will not allow your faithful follower to see the Pit.

<a name="16:11">16:11</a> You lead me in the path of life;
I experience absolute joy in your presence;
you always give me sheer delight.
