For the music director, according to the gittith style; a psalm of David.

<a name="8:1">8:1</a> O Lord, our sovereign Master,
how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!
You reveal your majesty in the heavens above!

<a name="8:2">8:2</a> When children and nursing babies cry for help,
you protect them from your foes,
so that you might put an end to the vindictive enemy.

<a name="8:3">8:3</a> When I look up at the heavens, which your fingers made,
and see the moon and the stars, which you set in place,

<a name="8:4">8:4</a> I think,
“Of what importance is the human race, that you should notice them?
Of what importance is mankind, that you should pay attention to them,

<a name="8:5">8:5</a> and make them almost like the heavenly beings?”
You grant mankind honor and majesty;

<a name="8:6">8:6</a> you allow them to rule over your creation;
you have placed everything under their authority,

<a name="8:7">8:7</a> including all the sheep and cattle,
as well as the wild animals,

<a name="8:8">8:8</a> the birds in the sky, the fish in the sea
and everything that moves through the channels of the seas.

<a name="8:9">8:9</a> O Lord, our sovereign Master,
how magnificent is your reputation throughout the earth!
