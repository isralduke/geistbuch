<a name="95:1">95:1</a> Come! Let’s sing for joy to the Lord!
Let’s shout out praises to our protector who delivers us!

<a name="95:2">95:2</a> Let’s enter his presence with thanksgiving!
Let’s shout out to him in celebration!

<a name="95:3">95:3</a> For the Lord is a great God,
a great king who is superior to all gods.

<a name="95:4">95:4</a> The depths of the earth are in his hand,
and the mountain peaks belong to him.

<a name="95:5">95:5</a> The sea is his, for he made it.
His hands formed the dry land.

<a name="95:6">95:6</a> Come! Let’s bow down and worship!
Let’s kneel before the Lord, our creator!

<a name="95:7">95:7</a> For he is our God;
we are the people of his pasture,
the sheep he owns.
Today, if only you would obey him!

<a name="95:8">95:8</a> He says, “Do not be stubborn like they were at Meribah,
like they were that day at Massah in the wilderness,

<a name="95:9">95:9</a> where your ancestors challenged my authority,
and tried my patience, even though they had seen my work.

<a name="95:10">95:10</a> For forty years I was continually disgusted with that generation,
and I said, ‘These people desire to go astray;
they do not obey my commands.’

<a name="95:11">95:11</a> So I made a vow in my anger,
‘They will never enter into the resting place I had set aside for them.’”
