A psalm of David.


<a name="101:1">101:1</a> I will sing about loyalty and justice!
To you, O Lord, I will sing praises!

<a name="101:2">101:2</a> I will walk in the way of integrity.
When will you come to me?
I will conduct my business with integrity in the midst of my palace.

<a name="101:3">101:3</a> I will not even consider doing what is dishonest.
I hate doing evil;
I will have no part of it.

<a name="101:4">101:4</a> I will have nothing to do with a perverse person;
I will not permit evil.

<a name="101:5">101:5</a> I will destroy anyone who slanders his neighbor in secret.
I will not tolerate anyone who has a cocky demeanor and an arrogant attitude.

<a name="101:6">101:6</a> I will favor the honest people of the land,
and allow them to live with me.
Those who walk in the way of integrity will attend me.

<a name="101:7">101:7</a> Deceitful people will not live in my palace.
Liars will not be welcome in my presence.

<a name="101:8">101:8</a> Each morning I will destroy all the wicked people in the land,
and remove all evildoers from the city of the Lord.
