A song of ascents.


<a name="125:1">125:1</a> Those who trust in the Lord are like Mount Zion;
it cannot be upended and will endure forever.

<a name="125:2">125:2</a> As the mountains surround Jerusalem,
so the Lord surrounds his people,
now and forevermore.

<a name="125:3">125:3</a> Indeed, the scepter of a wicked king will not settle
upon the allotted land of the godly.
Otherwise the godly might
do what is wrong.

<a name="125:4">125:4</a> Do good, O Lord, to those who are good,
to the morally upright!

<a name="125:5">125:5</a> As for those who are bent on traveling a sinful path,
may the Lord remove them, along with those who behave wickedly!
May Israel experience peace!
