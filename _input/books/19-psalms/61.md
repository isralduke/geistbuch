<a name="61:1">61:1</a> O God, hear my cry for help!
Pay attention to my prayer!

<a name="61:2">61:2</a> From the most remote place on earth
I call out to you in my despair.
Lead me up to an inaccessible rocky summit!

<a name="61:3">61:3</a> Indeed, you are my shelter,
a strong tower that protects me from the enemy.

<a name="61:4">61:4</a> I will be a permanent guest in your home;
I will find shelter in the protection of your wings. (Selah)

<a name="61:5">61:5</a> For you, O God, hear my vows;
you grant me the reward that belongs to your loyal followers.

<a name="61:6">61:6</a> Give the king long life!
Make his lifetime span several generations!

<a name="61:7">61:7</a> May he reign forever before God!
Decree that your loyal love and faithfulness should protect him.

<a name="61:8">61:8</a> Then I will sing praises to your name continually,
as I fulfill my vows day after day.
