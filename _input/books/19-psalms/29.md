A psalm of David.

<a name="29:1">29:1</a> Acknowledge the Lord, you supernatural beings,
acknowledge the Lord’s majesty and power!

<a name="29:2">29:2</a> Acknowledge the majesty of the Lord’s reputation!
Worship the Lord in holy attire!

<a name="29:3">29:3</a> The Lord’s shout is heard over the water;
the majestic God thunders,
the Lord appears over the surging water.

<a name="29:4">29:4</a> The Lord’s shout is powerful,
the Lord’s shout is majestic.

<a name="29:5">29:5</a> The Lord’s shout breaks the cedars,
the Lord shatters the cedars of Lebanon.

<a name="29:6">29:6</a> He makes Lebanon skip like a calf
and Sirion like a young ox.

<a name="29:7">29:7</a> The Lord’s shout strikes with flaming fire.

<a name="29:8">29:8</a> The Lord’s shout shakes the wilderness,
the Lord shakes the wilderness of Kadesh.

<a name="29:9">29:9</a> The Lord’s shout bends the large trees
and strips the leaves from the forests.
Everyone in his temple says, “Majestic!”

<a name="29:10">29:10</a> The Lord sits enthroned over the engulfing waters,
the Lord sits enthroned as the eternal king.

<a name="29:11">29:11</a> The Lord gives his people strength;
the Lord grants his people security.
