For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of David.

<a name="4:1">4:1</a> When I call out, answer me,
O God who vindicates me!
Though I am hemmed in, you will lead me into a wide, open place.
Have mercy on me and respond to my prayer!

<a name="4:2">4:2</a> You men, how long will you try to turn my honor into shame?
How long will you love what is worthless
and search for what is deceptive? (Selah)

<a name="4:3">4:3</a> Realize that the Lord shows his faithful follower special favor;
the Lord responds when I cry out to him.

<a name="4:4">4:4</a> Tremble with fear and do not sin!
Do some soul-searching as you lie in bed, and repent of your ways! (Selah)

<a name="4:5">4:5</a> Offer the prescribed sacrifices
and trust in the Lord!

<a name="4:6">4:6</a> Many say, “Who can show us anything good?”
Smile upon us, Lord!

<a name="4:7">4:7</a> You make me happier
than those who have abundant grain and wine.

<a name="4:8">4:8</a> I will lie down and sleep peacefully,
for you, Lord, make me safe and secure.
