A psalm of David.


<a name="143:1">143:1</a> O Lord, hear my prayer!
Pay attention to my plea for help!
Because of your faithfulness and justice, answer me!

<a name="143:2">143:2</a> Do not sit in judgment on your servant,
for no one alive is innocent before you.

<a name="143:3">143:3</a> Certainly my enemies chase me.
They smash me into the ground.
They force me to live in dark regions,
like those who have been dead for ages.

<a name="143:4">143:4</a> My strength leaves me;
I am absolutely shocked.

<a name="143:5">143:5</a> I recall the old days;
I meditate on all you have done;
I reflect on your accomplishments.

<a name="143:6">143:6</a> I spread my hands out to you in prayer;
my soul thirsts for you in a parched land.

<a name="143:7">143:7</a> Answer me quickly, Lord!
My strength is fading.
Do not reject me,
or I will join those descending into the grave.

<a name="143:8">143:8</a> May I hear about your loyal love in the morning,
for I trust in you.
Show me the way I should go,
because I long for you.

<a name="143:9">143:9</a> Rescue me from my enemies, O Lord!
I run to you for protection.

<a name="143:10">143:10</a> Teach me to do what pleases you,
for you are my God.
May your kind presence
lead me into a level land.

<a name="143:11">143:11</a> O Lord, for the sake of your reputation, revive me!
Because of your justice, rescue me from trouble!

<a name="143:12">143:12</a> As a demonstration of your loyal love, destroy my enemies!
Annihilate all who threaten my life,
for I am your servant.
