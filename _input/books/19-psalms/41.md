For the music director; a psalm of David.

<a name="41:1">41:1</a> How happy is the one who treats the poor properly!
When trouble comes, the Lord delivers him.

<a name="41:2">41:2</a> May the Lord protect him and save his life!
May he be blessed in the land!
Do not turn him over to his enemies!

<a name="41:3">41:3</a> The Lord supports him on his sickbed;
you completely heal him from his illness.

<a name="41:4">41:4</a> As for me, I said:
“O Lord, have mercy on me!
Heal me, for I have sinned against you!

<a name="41:5">41:5</a> My enemies ask this cruel question about me,
‘When will he finally die and be forgotten?’

<a name="41:6">41:6</a> When someone comes to visit, he pretends to be friendly;
he thinks of ways to defame me,
and when he leaves he slanders me.

<a name="41:7">41:7</a> All who hate me whisper insults about me to one another;
they plan ways to harm me.

<a name="41:8">41:8</a> They say,
‘An awful disease overwhelms him,
and now that he is bed-ridden he will never recover.’

<a name="41:9">41:9</a> Even my close friend whom I trusted,
he who shared meals with me, has turned against me.

<a name="41:10">41:10</a> As for you, O Lord, have mercy on me and raise me up,
so I can pay them back!”

<a name="41:11">41:11</a> By this I know that you are pleased with me,
for my enemy does not triumph over me.

<a name="41:12">41:12</a> As for me, you uphold me because of my integrity;
you allow me permanent access to your presence.

<a name="41:13">41:13</a> The Lord God of Israel deserves praise
in the future and forevermore!
We agree! We agree!
