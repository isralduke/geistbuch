For the music director; to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a psalm of Asaph, a song.

<a name="76:1">76:1</a> God has revealed himself in Judah;
in Israel his reputation is great.

<a name="76:2">76:2</a> He lives in Salem;
he dwells in Zion.

<a name="76:3">76:3</a> There he shattered the arrows,
the shield, the sword, and the rest of the weapons of war. (Selah)

<a name="76:4">76:4</a> You shine brightly and reveal your majesty,
as you descend from the hills where you killed your prey.

<a name="76:5">76:5</a> The bravehearted were plundered;
they “fell asleep.”
All the warriors were helpless.

<a name="76:6">76:6</a> At the sound of your battle cry, O God of Jacob,
both rider and horse “fell asleep.”

<a name="76:7">76:7</a> You are awesome! Yes, you!
Who can withstand your intense anger?

<a name="76:8">76:8</a> From heaven you announced what their punishment would be.
The earth was afraid and silent

<a name="76:9">76:9</a> when God arose to execute judgment,
and to deliver all the oppressed of the earth. (Selah)

<a name="76:10">76:10</a> Certainly your angry judgment upon men will bring you praise;
you reveal your anger in full measure.

<a name="76:11">76:11</a> Make vows to the Lord your God and repay them!
Let all those who surround him bring tribute to the awesome one!

<a name="76:12">76:12</a> He humbles princes;
the kings of the earth regard him as awesome.
