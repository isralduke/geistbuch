For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David, written when he fled from Saul into the cave.


<a name="57:1">57:1</a> Have mercy on me, O God! Have mercy on me!
For in you I have taken shelter.
In the shadow of your wings I take shelter
until trouble passes.

<a name="57:2">57:2</a> I cry out for help to the sovereign God,
to the God who vindicates me.

<a name="57:3">57:3</a> May he send help from heaven and deliver me
from my enemies who hurl insults! (Selah)
May God send his loyal love and faithfulness!

<a name="57:4">57:4</a> I am surrounded by lions;
I lie down among those who want to devour me;
men whose teeth are spears and arrows,
whose tongues are a sharp sword.

<a name="57:5">57:5</a> Rise up above the sky, O God!
May your splendor cover the whole earth!

<a name="57:6">57:6</a> They have prepared a net to trap me;
I am discouraged.
They have dug a pit for me.
They will fall into it! (Selah)

<a name="57:7">57:7</a> I am determined, O God! I am determined!
I will sing and praise you!

<a name="57:8">57:8</a> Awake, my soul!
Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!
I will wake up at dawn!

<a name="57:9">57:9</a> I will give you thanks before the nations, O Master!
I will sing praises to you before foreigners!

<a name="57:10">57:10</a> For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,
and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.

<a name="57:11">57:11</a> Rise up above the sky, O God!
May your splendor cover the whole earth!
