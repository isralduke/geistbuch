A psalm of David, written when he was in the Judean wilderness.


<a name="63:1">63:1</a> O God, you are my God! I long for you!
My soul thirsts for you,
my flesh yearns for you,
in a dry and parched land where there is no water.

<a name="63:2">63:2</a> Yes, in the sanctuary I have seen you,
and witnessed your power and splendor.

<a name="63:3">63:3</a> Because experiencing your loyal love is better than life itself,
my lips will praise you.

<a name="63:4">63:4</a> For this reason I will praise you while I live;
in your name I will lift up my hands.

<a name="63:5">63:5</a> As if with choice meat you satisfy my soul.
My mouth joyfully praises you,

<a name="63:6">63:6</a> whenever I remember you on my bed,
and think about you during the nighttime hours.

<a name="63:7">63:7</a> For you are my deliverer;
under your wings I rejoice.

<a name="63:8">63:8</a> My soul pursues you;
your right hand upholds me.

<a name="63:9">63:9</a> Enemies seek to destroy my life,
but they will descend into the depths of the earth.

<a name="63:10">63:10</a> Each one will be handed over to the sword;
their corpses will be eaten by jackals.

<a name="63:11">63:11</a> But the king will rejoice in God;
everyone who takes oaths in his name will boast,
for the mouths of those who speak lies will be shut up.
