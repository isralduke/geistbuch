A psalm of David.


<a name="141:1">141:1</a> O Lord, I cry out to you. Come quickly to me!
Pay attention to me when I cry out to you!

<a name="141:2">141:2</a> May you accept my prayer like incense,
my uplifted hands like the evening offering!

<a name="141:3">141:3</a> O Lord, place a guard on my mouth!
Protect the opening of my lips!

<a name="141:4">141:4</a> Do not let me have evil desires,
or participate in sinful activities
with men who behave wickedly.
I will not eat their delicacies.

<a name="141:5">141:5</a> May the godly strike me in love and correct me!
May my head not refuse choice oil!
Indeed, my prayer is a witness against their evil deeds.

<a name="141:6">141:6</a> They will be thrown down the side of a cliff by their judges.
They will listen to my words, for they are pleasant.

<a name="141:7">141:7</a> As when one plows and breaks up the soil,
so our bones are scattered at the mouth of Sheol.

<a name="141:8">141:8</a> Surely I am looking to you, O sovereign Lord.
In you I take shelter.
Do not expose me to danger!

<a name="141:9">141:9</a> Protect me from the snare they have laid for me,
and the traps the evildoers have set.

<a name="141:10">141:10</a> Let the wicked fall into their own nets,
while I escape.
