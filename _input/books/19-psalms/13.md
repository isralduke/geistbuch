For the music director; a psalm of David.

<a name="13:1">13:1</a> How long, Lord, will you continue to ignore me?
How long will you pay no attention to me?

<a name="13:2">13:2</a> How long must I worry,
and suffer in broad daylight?
How long will my enemy gloat over me?

<a name="13:3">13:3</a> Look at me! Answer me, O Lord my God!
Revive me, or else I will die!

<a name="13:4">13:4</a> Then my enemy will say, “I have defeated him!”
Then my foes will rejoice because I am upended.

<a name="13:5">13:5</a> But I trust in your faithfulness.
May I rejoice because of your deliverance!

<a name="13:6">13:6</a> I will sing praises to the Lord
when he vindicates me.
