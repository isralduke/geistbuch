By David.


<a name="138:1">138:1</a> I will give you thanks with all my heart;
before the heavenly assembly I will sing praises to you.

<a name="138:2">138:2</a> I will bow down toward your holy temple,
and give thanks to your name,
because of your loyal love and faithfulness,
for you have exalted your promise above the entire sky.

<a name="138:3">138:3</a> When I cried out for help, you answered me.
You made me bold and energized me.

<a name="138:4">138:4</a> Let all the kings of the earth give thanks to you, O Lord,
when they hear the words you speak.

<a name="138:5">138:5</a> Let them sing about the Lord’s deeds,
for the Lord’s splendor is magnificent.

<a name="138:6">138:6</a> Though the Lord is exalted, he takes note of the lowly,
and recognizes the proud from far away.

<a name="138:7">138:7</a> Even when I must walk in the midst of danger, you revive me.
You oppose my angry enemies,
and your right hand delivers me.

<a name="138:8">138:8</a> The Lord avenges me.
O Lord, your loyal love endures.
Do not abandon those whom you have made!
