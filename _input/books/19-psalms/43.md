<a name="43:1">43:1</a> Vindicate me, O God!
Fight for me against an ungodly nation!
Deliver me from deceitful and evil men!

<a name="43:2">43:2</a> For you are the God who shelters me.
Why do you reject me?
Why must I walk around mourning
because my enemies oppress me?

<a name="43:3">43:3</a> Reveal your light and your faithfulness!
They will lead me,
they will escort me back to your holy hill,
and to the place where you live.

<a name="43:4">43:4</a> Then I will go to the altar of God,
to the God who gives me ecstatic joy,
so that I express my thanks to you, O God, my God, with a harp.

<a name="43:5">43:5</a> Why are you depressed, O my soul?
Why are you upset?
Wait for God!
For I will again give thanks
to my God for his saving intervention.
