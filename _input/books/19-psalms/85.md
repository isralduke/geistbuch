For the music director; written by the Korahites, a psalm.

<a name="85:1">85:1</a> O Lord, you showed favor to your land;
you restored the well-being of Jacob.

<a name="85:2">85:2</a> You pardoned the wrongdoing of your people;
you forgave all their sin. (Selah)

<a name="85:3">85:3</a> You withdrew all your fury;
you turned back from your raging anger.

<a name="85:4">85:4</a> Restore us, O God our deliverer!
Do not be displeased with us!

<a name="85:5">85:5</a> Will you stay mad at us forever?
Will you remain angry throughout future generations?

<a name="85:6">85:6</a> Will you not revive us once more?
Then your people will rejoice in you!

<a name="85:7">85:7</a> O Lord, show us your loyal love!
Bestow on us your deliverance!

<a name="85:8">85:8</a> I will listen to what God the Lord says.
For he will make peace with his people, his faithful followers.
Yet they must not return to their foolish ways.

<a name="85:9">85:9</a> Certainly his loyal followers will soon experience his deliverance;
then his splendor will again appear in our land.

<a name="85:10">85:10</a> Loyal love and faithfulness meet;
deliverance and peace greet each other with a kiss.

<a name="85:11">85:11</a> Faithfulness grows from the ground,
and deliverance looks down from the sky.

<a name="85:12">85:12</a> Yes, the Lord will bestow his good blessings,
and our land will yield its crops.

<a name="85:13">85:13</a> Deliverance goes before him,
and prepares a pathway for him.
