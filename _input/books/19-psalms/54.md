For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments; a well-written song by David. It was written when the Ziphites came and informed Saul: “David is hiding with us.”


<a name="54:1">54:1</a> O God, deliver me by your name!
Vindicate me by your power!

<a name="54:2">54:2</a> O God, listen to my prayer!
Pay attention to what I say!

<a name="54:3">54:3</a> For foreigners attack me;
ruthless men, who do not respect God, seek my life. (Selah)

<a name="54:4">54:4</a> Look, God is my deliverer!
The sovereign Master is among those who support me.

<a name="54:5">54:5</a> May those who wait to ambush me be repaid for their evil!
As a demonstration of your faithfulness, destroy them!

<a name="54:6">54:6</a> With a freewill offering I will sacrifice to you!
I will give thanks to your name, O Lord, for it is good!

<a name="54:7">54:7</a> Surely he rescues me from all trouble,
and I triumph over my enemies.
