<a name="1:1">1:1</a> How happy is the one who does not follow the advice of the wicked,
or stand in the pathway with sinners,
or sit in the assembly of arrogant fools!

<a name="1:2">1:2</a> Instead he finds pleasure in obeying the Lordâ€™s commands;
he intently studies his commands day and night.

<a name="1:3">1:3</a> He is like a tree planted by flowing streams;
it yields its fruit at the proper time,
and its leaves never fall off.
He succeeds in everything he attempts.

<a name="1:4">1:4</a> Not so with the wicked!
Instead they are like wind-driven chaff.

<a name="1:5">1:5</a> For this reason the wicked cannot withstand judgment,
nor can sinners join the assembly of the godly.

<a name="1:6">1:6</a> Certainly the Lord rewards the behavior of the godly,
but the behavior of the wicked is self-destructive.
