A song, a psalm by the Korahites.


<a name="48:1">48:1</a> The Lord is great and certainly worthy of praise
in the city of our God, his holy hill.

<a name="48:2">48:2</a> It is lofty and pleasing to look at,
a source of joy to the whole earth.
Mount Zion resembles the peaks of Zaphon;
it is the city of the great king.

<a name="48:3">48:3</a> God is in its fortresses;
he reveals himself as its defender.

<a name="48:4">48:4</a> For look, the kings assemble;
they advance together.

<a name="48:5">48:5</a> As soon as they see, they are shocked;
they are terrified, they quickly retreat.

<a name="48:6">48:6</a> Look at them shake uncontrollably,
like a woman writhing in childbirth.

<a name="48:7">48:7</a> With an east wind
you shatter the large ships.

<a name="48:8">48:8</a> We heard about Godâ€™s mighty deeds, now we have seen them,
in the city of the Lord, the invincible Warrior,
in the city of our God.
God makes it permanently secure. (Selah)

<a name="48:9">48:9</a> We reflect on your loyal love, O God,
within your temple.

<a name="48:10">48:10</a> The praise you receive as far away as the ends of the earth
is worthy of your reputation, O God.
You execute justice!

<a name="48:11">48:11</a> Mount Zion rejoices;
the towns of Judah are happy,
because of your acts of judgment.

<a name="48:12">48:12</a> Walk around Zion! Encircle it!
Count its towers!

<a name="48:13">48:13</a> Consider its defenses!
Walk through its fortresses,
so you can tell the next generation about it!

<a name="48:14">48:14</a> For God, our God, is our defender forever!
He guides us!
