For the music director; written by the Lordâ€™s servant, David; an oracle.

<a name="36:1">36:1</a> An evil man is rebellious to the core.
He does not fear God,

<a name="36:2">36:2</a> for he is too proud
to recognize and give up his sin.

<a name="36:3">36:3</a> The words he speaks are sinful and deceitful;
he does not care about doing what is wise and right.

<a name="36:4">36:4</a> He plans ways to sin while he lies in bed;
he is committed to a sinful lifestyle;
he does not reject what is evil.

<a name="36:5">36:5</a> O Lord, your loyal love reaches to the sky;
your faithfulness to the clouds.

<a name="36:6">36:6</a> Your justice is like the highest mountains,
your fairness like the deepest sea;
you preserve mankind and the animal kingdom.

<a name="36:7">36:7</a> How precious is your loyal love, O God!
The human race finds shelter under your wings.

<a name="36:8">36:8</a> They are filled with food from your house,
and you allow them to drink from the river of your delicacies.

<a name="36:9">36:9</a> For you are the one who gives
and sustains life.

<a name="36:10">36:10</a> Extend your loyal love to your faithful followers,
and vindicate the morally upright!

<a name="36:11">36:11</a> Do not let arrogant men overtake me,
or let evil men make me homeless!

<a name="36:12">36:12</a> I can see the evildoers! They have fallen!
They have been knocked down and are unable to get up!
