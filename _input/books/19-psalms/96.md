Let the sea and everything in it shout!

<a name="96:12">96:12</a> Let the fields and everything in them celebrate!
Then let the trees of the forest shout with joy

<a name="96:13">96:13</a> before the Lord, for he comes!
For he comes to judge the earth!
He judges the world fairly,
and the nations in accordance with his justice.
