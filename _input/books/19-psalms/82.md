A psalm of Asaph.

<a name="82:1">82:1</a> God stands in the assembly of El;
in the midst of the gods he renders judgment.

<a name="82:2">82:2</a> He says, “How long will you make unjust legal decisions
and show favoritism to the wicked? (Selah)

<a name="82:3">82:3</a> Defend the cause of the poor and the fatherless!
Vindicate the oppressed and suffering!

<a name="82:4">82:4</a> Rescue the poor and needy!
Deliver them from the power of the wicked!

<a name="82:5">82:5</a> They neither know nor understand.
They stumble around in the dark,
while all the foundations of the earth crumble.

<a name="82:6">82:6</a> I thought, ‘You are gods;
all of you are sons of the Most High.’

<a name="82:7">82:7</a> Yet you will die like mortals;
you will fall like all the other rulers.”

<a name="82:8">82:8</a> Rise up, O God, and execute judgment on the earth!
For you own all the nations.
