A song of ascents.


<a name="123:1">123:1</a> I look up toward you,
the one enthroned in heaven.

<a name="123:2">123:2</a> Look, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master,
as the eyes of a female servant look to the hand of her mistress,
so my eyes will look to the Lord, our God, until he shows us favor.

<a name="123:3">123:3</a> Show us favor, O Lord, show us favor!
For we have had our fill of humiliation, and then some.

<a name="123:4">123:4</a> We have had our fill
of the taunts of the self-assured,
of the contempt of the proud.
