For the music director; according to the al-tashcheth style; a prayer of David.


<a name="58:1">58:1</a> Do you rulers really pronounce just decisions?
Do you judge people fairly?

<a name="58:2">58:2</a> No! You plan how to do what is unjust;
you deal out violence in the earth.

<a name="58:3">58:3</a> The wicked turn aside from birth;
liars go astray as soon as they are born.

<a name="58:4">58:4</a> Their venom is like that of a snake,
like a deaf serpent that does not hear,

<a name="58:5">58:5</a> that does not respond to the magicians,
or to a skilled snake-charmer.

<a name="58:6">58:6</a> O God, break the teeth in their mouths!
Smash the jawbones of the lions, O Lord!

<a name="58:7">58:7</a> Let them disappear like water that flows away!
Let them wither like grass!

<a name="58:8">58:8</a> Let them be like a snail that melts away as it moves along!
Let them be like stillborn babies that never see the sun!

<a name="58:9">58:9</a> Before the kindling is even placed under your pots,
he will sweep it away along with both the raw and cooked meat.

<a name="58:10">58:10</a> The godly will rejoice when they see vengeance carried out;
they will bathe their feet in the blood of the wicked.

<a name="58:11">58:11</a> Then observers will say,
“Yes indeed, the godly are rewarded!
Yes indeed, there is a God who judges in the earth!”
