A song of ascents, by David.


<a name="133:1">133:1</a> Look! How good and how pleasant it is
when brothers live together!

<a name="133:2">133:2</a> It is like fine oil poured on the head
which flows down the beard — 
Aaron’s beard,
and then flows down his garments.

<a name="133:3">133:3</a> It is like the dew of Hermon,
which flows down upon the hills of Zion.
Indeed that is where the Lord has decreed
a blessing will be available — eternal life.
