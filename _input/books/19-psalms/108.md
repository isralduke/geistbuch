A song, a psalm of David.


<a name="108:1">108:1</a> I am determined, O God!
I will sing and praise you with my whole heart.

<a name="108:2">108:2</a> Awake, O stringed instrument and harp!
I will wake up at dawn!

<a name="108:3">108:3</a> I will give you thanks before the nations, O Lord!
I will sing praises to you before foreigners!

<a name="108:4">108:4</a> For your loyal love extends beyond the sky,
and your faithfulness reaches the clouds.

<a name="108:5">108:5</a> Rise up above the sky, O God!
May your splendor cover the whole earth!

<a name="108:6">108:6</a> Deliver by your power and answer me,
so that the ones you love may be safe.

<a name="108:7">108:7</a> God has spoken in his sanctuary:
“I will triumph! I will parcel out Shechem,
the valley of Succoth I will measure off.

<a name="108:8">108:8</a> Gilead belongs to me,
as does Manasseh!
Ephraim is my helmet,
Judah my royal scepter.

<a name="108:9">108:9</a> Moab is my wash basin.
I will make Edom serve me.
I will shout in triumph over Philistia.”

<a name="108:10">108:10</a> Who will lead me into the fortified city?
Who will bring me to Edom?

<a name="108:11">108:11</a> Have you not rejected us, O God?
O God, you do not go into battle with our armies.

<a name="108:12">108:12</a> Give us help against the enemy,
for any help men might offer is futile.

<a name="108:13">108:13</a> By God’s power we will conquer;
he will trample down our enemies.
