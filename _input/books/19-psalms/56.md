For the music director; according to the yonath-elem-rechovim style; a prayer of David, written when the Philistines captured him in Gath.


<a name="56:1">56:1</a> Have mercy on me, O God, for men are attacking me!
All day long hostile enemies are tormenting me.

<a name="56:2">56:2</a> Those who anticipate my defeat attack me all day long.
Indeed, many are fighting against me, O Exalted One.

<a name="56:3">56:3</a> When I am afraid,
I trust in you.

<a name="56:4">56:4</a> In God — I boast in his promise — 
in God I trust, I am not afraid.
What can mere men do to me?

<a name="56:5">56:5</a> All day long they cause me trouble;
they make a habit of plotting my demise.

<a name="56:6">56:6</a> They stalk and lurk;
they watch my every step,
as they prepare to take my life.

<a name="56:7">56:7</a> Because they are bent on violence, do not let them escape!
In your anger bring down the nations, O God!

<a name="56:8">56:8</a> You keep track of my misery.
Put my tears in your leather container!
Are they not recorded in your scroll?

<a name="56:9">56:9</a> My enemies will turn back when I cry out to you for help;
I know that God is on my side.

<a name="56:10">56:10</a> In God — I boast in his promise — 
in the Lord — I boast in his promise — 

<a name="56:11">56:11</a> in God I trust, I am not afraid.
What can mere men do to me?

<a name="56:12">56:12</a> I am obligated to fulfill the vows I made to you, O God;
I will give you the thank-offerings you deserve,

<a name="56:13">56:13</a> when you deliver my life from death.
You keep my feet from stumbling,
so that I might serve God as I enjoy life.
