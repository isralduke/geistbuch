A psalm — a song used at the dedication of the temple; by David.

<a name="30:1">30:1</a> I will praise you, O Lord, for you lifted me up,
and did not allow my enemies to gloat over me.

<a name="30:2">30:2</a> O Lord my God,
I cried out to you and you healed me.

<a name="30:3">30:3</a> O Lord, you pulled me up from Sheol;
you rescued me from among those descending into the grave.

<a name="30:4">30:4</a> Sing to the Lord, you faithful followers of his;
give thanks to his holy name.

<a name="30:5">30:5</a> For his anger lasts only a brief moment,
and his good favor restores one’s life.
One may experience sorrow during the night,
but joy arrives in the morning.

<a name="30:6">30:6</a> In my self-confidence I said,
“I will never be upended.”

<a name="30:7">30:7</a> O Lord, in your good favor you made me secure.
Then you rejected me and I was terrified.

<a name="30:8">30:8</a> To you, O Lord, I cried out;
I begged the sovereign Master for mercy:

<a name="30:9">30:9</a> “What profit is there in taking my life,
in my descending into the Pit?
Can the dust of the grave praise you?
Can it declare your loyalty?

<a name="30:10">30:10</a> Hear, O Lord, and have mercy on me!
O Lord, deliver me!”

<a name="30:11">30:11</a> Then you turned my lament into dancing;
you removed my sackcloth and covered me with joy.

<a name="30:12">30:12</a> So now my heart will sing to you and not be silent;
O Lord my God, I will always give thanks to you.
