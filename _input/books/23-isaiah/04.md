<a name="4:1">4:1</a> Seven women will grab hold of
one man at that time.
They will say, “We will provide our own food,
we will provide our own clothes;
but let us belong to you — 
take away our shame!”

## The Branch of the Lord

<a name="4:2">4:2</a> At that time
the crops given by the Lord will bring admiration and honor;
the produce of the land will be a source of pride and delight
to those who remain in Israel.

<a name="4:3">4:3</a> Those remaining in Zion, those left in Jerusalem,
will be called “holy,”
all in Jerusalem who are destined to live.

<a name="4:4">4:4</a> At that time the sovereign master will wash the excrement from Zion’s women,
he will rinse the bloodstains from Jerusalem’s midst,
as he comes to judge
and to bring devastation.

<a name="4:5">4:5</a> Then the Lord will create
over all of Mount Zion
and over its convocations
a cloud and smoke by day
and a bright flame of fire by night;
indeed a canopy will accompany the Lord’s glorious presence.

<a name="4:6">4:6</a> By day it will be a shelter to provide shade from the heat,
as well as safety and protection from the heavy downpour.
