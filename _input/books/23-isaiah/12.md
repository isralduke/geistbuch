<a name="12:1">12:1</a> At that time you will say:
“I praise you, O Lord,
for even though you were angry with me,
your anger subsided, and you consoled me.

<a name="12:2">12:2</a> Look, God is my deliverer!
I will trust in him and not fear.
For the Lord gives me strength and protects me;
he has become my deliverer.”

<a name="12:3">12:3</a> Joyfully you will draw water
from the springs of deliverance.

<a name="12:4">12:4</a> At that time you will say:
“Praise the Lord!
Ask him for help!
Publicize his mighty acts among the nations!
Make it known that he is unique!

<a name="12:5">12:5</a> Sing to the Lord, for he has done magnificent things,
let this be known throughout the earth!

<a name="12:6">12:6</a> Cry out and shout for joy, O citizens of Zion,
for the sovereign king of Israel acts mightily among you!”
