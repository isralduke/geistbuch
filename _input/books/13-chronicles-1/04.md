<a name="4:9">4:9</a> Jabez was more respected than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, for she said, “I experienced pain when I gave birth to him.” <a name="4:10">4:10</a> Jabez called out to the God of Israel, “If only you would greatly bless me and expand my territory! May your hand be with me! Keep me from harm so I might not endure pain!” God answered his prayer.

<a name="4:11">4:11</a> Kelub, the brother of Shuhah, was the father of Mehir, who was the father of Eshton. <a name="4:12">4:12</a> Eshton was the father of Beth-Rapha, Paseah, and Tehinnah, the father of Ir Nahash. These were the men of Recah.

## Simeon’s Descendants

<a name="4:24">4:24</a> The descendants of Simeon:

Nemuel, Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, Shaul, <a name="4:25">4:25</a> his son Shallum, his son Mibsam, and his son Mishma.

<a name="4:26">4:26</a> The descendants of Mishma:

His son Hammuel, his son Zakkur, and his son Shimei.

<a name="4:27">4:27</a> Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters. But his brothers did not have many sons, so their whole clan was not as numerous as the sons of Judah. <a name="4:28">4:28</a> They lived in Beer Sheba, Moladah, Hazar Shual, <a name="4:29">4:29</a> Bilhah, Ezem, Tolad, <a name="4:30">4:30</a> Bethuel, Hormah, Ziklag, <a name="4:31">4:31</a> Beth Markaboth, Hazar Susim, Beth Biri, and Shaaraim. These were their towns until the reign of David. <a name="4:32">4:32</a> Their settlements also included Etam, Ain, Rimmon, Tochen, and Ashan — five towns. <a name="4:33">4:33</a> They also lived in all the settlements that surrounded these towns as far as Baal. These were their settlements; they kept genealogical records.

<a name="4:34">4:34</a> Their clan leaders were:

Meshobab, Jamlech, Joshah son of Amaziah, <a name="4:35">4:35</a> Joel, Jehu son of Joshibiah (son of Seraiah, son of Asiel), <a name="4:36">4:36</a> Eleoenai, Jaakobah, Jeshohaiah, Asaiah, Adiel, Jesimiel, Benaiah, <a name="4:37">4:37</a> Ziza son of Shipi (son of Allon, son of Jedaiah, son of Shimri, son of Shemaiah). <a name="4:38">4:38</a> These who are named above were the leaders of their clans.

Their extended families increased greatly in numbers. <a name="4:39">4:39</a> They went to the entrance of Gedor, to the east of the valley, looking for pasture for their sheep. <a name="4:40">4:40</a> They found fertile and rich pasture; the land was very broad, undisturbed and peaceful. Indeed some Hamites had been living there prior to that. <a name="4:41">4:41</a> The men whose names are listed came during the time of King Hezekiah of Judah and attacked the Hamites’ settlements, as well as the Meunites they discovered there, and they wiped them out to this very day. They dispossessed them, for they found pasture for their sheep there. <a name="4:42">4:42</a> Five hundred men of Simeon, led by Pelatiah, Neariah, Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi, went to the hill country of Seir <a name="4:43">4:43</a> and defeated the rest of the Amalekite refugees; they live there to this very day.
