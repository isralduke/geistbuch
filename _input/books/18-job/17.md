> <a name="17:1">17:1</a> My spirit is broken,
> my days have faded out,
> the grave awaits me.
> <a name="17:2">17:2</a> Surely mockery is with me;
> my eyes must dwell on their hostility.
> <a name="17:3">17:3</a> Make then my pledge with you.
> Who else will put up security for me?
> <a name="17:4">17:4</a> Because you have closed their minds to understanding,
> therefore you will not exalt them.
> <a name="17:5">17:5</a> If a man denounces his friends for personal gain,
> the eyes of his children will fail.
> <a name="17:6">17:6</a> He has made me a byword to people,
> I am the one in whose face they spit.
> <a name="17:7">17:7</a> My eyes have grown dim with grief;
> my whole frame is but a shadow.
> <a name="17:8">17:8</a> Upright men are appalled at this;

## Anticipation of Death

> <a name="17:10">17:10</a> “But turn, all of you, and come now!
> I will not find a wise man among you.
> <a name="17:11">17:11</a> My days have passed, my plans are shattered,
> even the desires of my heart.
> <a name="17:12">17:12</a> These men change night into day;
> they say, ‘The light is near
> in the face of darkness.’
> <a name="17:13">17:13</a> If I hope for the grave to be my home,
> if I spread out my bed in darkness,
> <a name="17:14">17:14</a> If I cry to corruption, ‘You are my father,’
> and to the worm, ‘My Mother,’ or ‘My sister,’
> <a name="17:15">17:15</a> and where then is my hope?
> And my hope, who sees it?
> <a name="17:16">17:16</a> Will it go down to the bars of death?
> Will we descend together into the dust?”
