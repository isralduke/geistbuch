## Baruch is Rebuked but also Comforted

<a name="45:1">45:1</a> The prophet Jeremiah spoke to Baruch son of Neriah while he was writing down in a scroll the words that Jeremiah spoke to him. This happened in the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was ruling over Judah. He said, <a name="45:2">45:2</a> “The Lord God of Israel has a message for you, Baruch. He says, <a name="45:3">45:3</a> ‘You have said, “I feel so hopeless! For the Lord has added sorrow to my suffering. I am worn out from groaning. I can’t find any rest.”’”

<a name="45:4">45:4</a> The Lord told Jeremiah, “Tell Baruch, ‘The Lord says, “I am about to tear down what I have built and to uproot what I have planted. I will do this throughout the whole earth. <a name="45:5">45:5</a> Are you looking for great things for yourself? Do not look for such things. For I, the Lord, affirm that I am about to bring disaster on all mankind. But I will let you escape with your life wherever you go.”’”
