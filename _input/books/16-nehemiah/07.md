<a name="7:1">7:1</a> When the wall had been rebuilt and I had positioned the doors, and the gate-keepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed, <a name="7:2">7:2</a> I then put in charge over Jerusalem my brother Hanani and Hananiah the chief of the citadel, for he was a faithful man and feared God more than many do. <a name="7:3">7:3</a> I said to them, “The gates of Jerusalem must not be opened in the early morning, until those who are standing guard close the doors and lock them. Position residents of Jerusalem as guards, some at their guard stations and some near their homes.” <a name="7:4">7:4</a> Now the city was spread out and large, and there were not a lot of people in it. At that time houses had not been rebuilt. <a name="7:5">7:5</a> My God placed it on my heart to gather the nobles, the officials, and the people so they could be enrolled on the basis of genealogy. I found the genealogical records of those who had formerly returned. Here is what I found written in that record:

<a name="7:6">7:6</a> These are the people of the province who were going up from the captivity of the exiles, whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had forced into exile. They returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, each to his own city. <a name="7:7">7:7</a> They came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah.
