## Burning a Useless Vine

<a name="15:1">15:1</a> The word of the Lord came to me: <a name="15:2">15:2</a> “Son of man, what will happen to the wood of the vine, the vine branch among the trees of the forest? <a name="15:3">15:3</a> Can wood be taken from it to make anything useful? Or can anyone make a peg from it to hang objects on? <a name="15:4">15:4</a> It is thrown in the fire for fuel; when the fire has burned up both ends of it and it is charred in the middle, will it be useful for anything? <a name="15:5">15:5</a> If it was not made into anything useful when it was whole, how much less can it be useful for anything when the fire has burned it up and it is charred?

<a name="15:6">15:6</a> “Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says: Like the wood of the vine among the trees of the forest which I have provided as fuel for the fire, so I will give the residents of Jerusalem over to destruction. <a name="15:7">15:7</a> I will set my face against them — although they have escaped from the fire, the fire will still consume them! Then you will know that I am the Lord, when I set my face against them. <a name="15:8">15:8</a> I will make the land desolate because they have acted unfaithfully, declares the Sovereign Lord.”
