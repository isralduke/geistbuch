## Messengers from Babylon Visit Hezekiah

<a name="39:1">39:1</a> At that time Merodach-Baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he heard that Hezekiah had been ill and had recovered. <a name="39:2">39:2</a> Hezekiah welcomed them and showed them his storehouse with its silver, gold, spices, and high-quality olive oil, as well as his whole armory and everything in his treasuries. Hezekiah showed them everything in his palace and in his whole kingdom. <a name="39:3">39:3</a> Isaiah the prophet visited King Hezekiah and asked him, “What did these men say? Where do they come from?” Hezekiah replied, “They come from the distant land of Babylon.” <a name="39:4">39:4</a> Isaiah asked, “What have they seen in your palace?” Hezekiah replied, “They have seen everything in my palace. I showed them everything in my treasuries.” <a name="39:5">39:5</a> Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of the Lord who leads armies: <a name="39:6">39:6</a> ‘Look, a time is coming when everything in your palace and the things your ancestors have accumulated to this day will be carried away to Babylon; nothing will be left,’ says the Lord. <a name="39:7">39:7</a> ‘Some of your very own descendants that you father will be taken away and will be made eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’” <a name="39:8">39:8</a> Hezekiah said to Isaiah, “The Lord’s word which you have announced is appropriate.” Then he thought, “For there will be peace and stability during my lifetime.”
