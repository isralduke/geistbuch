## The Lord Will Judge a Distant Land in the South


<a name="18:1">18:1</a> The land of buzzing wings is as good as dead,
the one beyond the rivers of Cush,

<a name="18:2">18:2</a> that sends messengers by sea,
who glide over the water’s surface in boats made of papyrus.
Go, you swift messengers,
to a nation of tall, smooth-skinned people,
to a people that are feared far and wide,
to a nation strong and victorious,
whose land rivers divide.

<a name="18:3">18:3</a> All you who live in the world,
who reside on the earth,
you will see a signal flag raised on the mountains;
you will hear a trumpet being blown.

<a name="18:4">18:4</a> For this is what the Lord has told me:
“I will wait and watch from my place,
like scorching heat produced by the sunlight,
like a cloud of mist in the heat of harvest.”

<a name="18:5">18:5</a> For before the harvest, when the bud has sprouted,
and the ripening fruit appears,
he will cut off the unproductive shoots with pruning knives;
he will prune the tendrils.

<a name="18:6">18:6</a> They will all be left for the birds of the hills
and the wild animals;
the birds will eat them during the summer,
and all the wild animals will eat them during the winter.

<a name="18:7">18:7</a> At that time
tribute will be brought to the Lord who leads armies,
by a people that are tall and smooth-skinned,
a people that are feared far and wide,
a nation strong and victorious,
whose land rivers divide.
The tribute will be brought to the place where the Lord who leads armies has chosen to reside, on Mount Zion.
