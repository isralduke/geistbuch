## Bildad’s Third Speech 

<a name="25:1">25:1</a> Then Bildad the Shuhite answered:

> <a name="25:2">25:2</a> “Dominion and awesome might belong to God;
> he establishes peace in his heights.
> <a name="25:3">25:3</a> Can his armies be numbered?
> On whom does his light not rise?
> <a name="25:4">25:4</a> How then can a human being be righteous before God?
> How can one born of a woman be pure?
> <a name="25:5">25:5</a> If even the moon is not bright,
> and the stars are not pure as far as he is concerned,
> <a name="25:6">25:6</a> how much less a mortal man, who is but a maggot — 
> a son of man, who is only a worm!”
