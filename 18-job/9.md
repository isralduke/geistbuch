## Job’s Reply to Bildad 

<a name="9:1">9:1</a> Then Job answered:

> <a name="9:2">9:2</a> “Truly, I know that this is so.
> But how can a human be just before God?
> <a name="9:3">9:3</a> If someone wishes to contend with him,
> he cannot answer him one time in a thousand.
> <a name="9:4">9:4</a> He is wise in heart and mighty in strength — 
> who has resisted him and remained safe?
> <a name="9:5">9:5</a> He who removes mountains suddenly,
> who overturns them in his anger;
> <a name="9:6">9:6</a> he who shakes the earth out of its place
> so that its pillars tremble;
> <a name="9:7">9:7</a> he who commands the sun and it does not shine
> and seals up the stars;
> <a name="9:8">9:8</a> he alone spreads out the heavens,
> and treads upon the waves of the sea;
> <a name="9:9">9:9</a> he makes the Bear, Orion, and the Pleiades,
> and the constellations of the south;
> <a name="9:10">9:10</a> he does great and unsearchable things,
> and wonderful things without number.
> <a name="9:11">9:11</a> If he passes by me, I cannot see him,
> if he goes by, I cannot perceive him.
> <a name="9:12">9:12</a> If he snatches away, who can turn him back?
> Who dares to say to him, ‘What are you doing?’
> <a name="9:13">9:13</a> God does not restrain his anger;
> under him the helpers of Rahab lie crushed.

## The Impossibility of Facing God in Court

> <a name="9:14">9:14</a> “How much less, then, can I answer him
> and choose my words to argue with him!
> <a name="9:15">9:15</a> Although I am innocent,
> I could not answer him;
> I could only plead with my judge for mercy.
> <a name="9:16">9:16</a> If I summoned him, and he answered me,
> I would not believe
> that he would be listening to my voice — 
> <a name="9:17">9:17</a> he who crushes me with a tempest,
> and multiplies my wounds for no reason.
> <a name="9:18">9:18</a> He does not allow me to recover my breath,
> for he fills me with bitterness.
> <a name="9:19">9:19</a> If it is a matter of strength,
> most certainly he is the strong one!
> And if it is a matter of justice,
> he will say, ‘Who will summon me?’
> <a name="9:20">9:20</a> Although I am innocent,
> my mouth would condemn me;
> although I am blameless,
> it would declare me perverse.
> <a name="9:21">9:21</a> I am blameless. I do not know myself.
> I despise my life.

## Accusation of God’s Justice

> <a name="9:22">9:22</a> “It is all one! That is why I say,
> ‘He destroys the blameless and the guilty.’
> <a name="9:23">9:23</a> If a scourge brings sudden death,
> he mocks at the despair of the innocent.
> <a name="9:24">9:24</a> If a land has been given
> into the hand of a wicked man,
> he covers the faces of its judges;
> if it is not he, then who is it?

## Renewed Complaint

> <a name="9:25">9:25</a> “My days are swifter than a runner,
> they speed by without seeing happiness.
> <a name="9:26">9:26</a> They glide by like reed boats,
> like an eagle that swoops down on its prey.
> <a name="9:27">9:27</a> If I say, ‘I will forget my complaint,
> I will change my expression and be cheerful,’
> <a name="9:28">9:28</a> I dread all my sufferings,
> for I know that you do not hold me blameless.
> <a name="9:29">9:29</a> If I am guilty,
> why then weary myself in vain?
> <a name="9:30">9:30</a> If I wash myself with snow water,
> and make my hands clean with lye,
> <a name="9:31">9:31</a> then you plunge me into a slimy pit
> and my own clothes abhor me.
> <a name="9:32">9:32</a> For he is not a human being like I am,
> that I might answer him,
> that we might come together in judgment.
> <a name="9:33">9:33</a> Nor is there an arbiter between us,
> who might lay his hand on us both,
> <a name="9:34">9:34</a> who would take his rod away from me
> so that his terror would not make me afraid.
> <a name="9:35">9:35</a> Then would I speak and not fear him,
> but it is not so with me.
