## Purification of a Woman after Childbirth

<a name="12:1">12:1</a> The Lord spoke to Moses: <a name="12:2">12:2</a> “Tell the Israelites, ‘When a woman produces offspring and bears a male child, she will be unclean seven days, as she is unclean during the days of her menstruation. <a name="12:3">12:3</a> On the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin must be circumcised. <a name="12:4">12:4</a> Then she will remain thirty-three days in blood purity. She must not touch anything holy and she must not enter the sanctuary until the days of her purification are fulfilled. <a name="12:5">12:5</a> If she bears a female child, she will be impure fourteen days as during her menstrual flow, and she will remain sixty-six days in blood purity.

<a name="12:6">12:6</a> “‘When the days of her purification are completed for a son or for a daughter, she must bring a one year old lamb for a burnt offering and a young pigeon or turtledove for a sin offering to the doorway of the Meeting Tent, to the priest. <a name="12:7">12:7</a> He is to present it before The Lord and make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean from her flow of blood. This is the law of the one who bears a child, for the male or the female child. <a name="12:8">12:8</a> If she cannot afford a sheep, then she must take two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a burnt offering and one for a sin offering, and the priest is to make atonement on her behalf, and she will be clean.’”
