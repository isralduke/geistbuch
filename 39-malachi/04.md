The coming day will burn them up,” says the sovereign Lord. “It will not leave even a root or branch. <a name="4:2">4:2</a> But for you who respect my name, the sun of vindication will rise with healing wings, and you will skip about like calves released from the stall. <a name="4:3">4:3</a> You will trample on the wicked, for they will be like ashes under the soles of your feet on the day which I am preparing,” says the sovereign Lord.
