<a name="70:1">70:1</a> O God, please be willing to rescue me!
O Lord, hurry and help me!

<a name="70:2">70:2</a> May those who are trying to take my life
be embarrassed and ashamed!
May those who want to harm me
be turned back and ashamed!

<a name="70:3">70:3</a> May those who say, “Aha! Aha!”
be driven back and disgraced!

<a name="70:4">70:4</a> May all those who seek you be happy and rejoice in you!
May those who love to experience your deliverance say continually,
“May God be praised!”

<a name="70:5">70:5</a> I am oppressed and needy!
O God, hurry to me!
You are my helper and my deliverer!
O Lord, do not delay!
