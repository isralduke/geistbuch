<a name="116:1">116:1</a> I love the Lord
because he heard my plea for mercy,

<a name="116:2">116:2</a> and listened to me.
As long as I live, I will call to him when I need help.

<a name="116:3">116:3</a> The ropes of death tightened around me,
the snares of Sheol confronted me.
I was confronted with trouble and sorrow.

<a name="116:4">116:4</a> I called on the name of the Lord,
“Please Lord, rescue my life!”

<a name="116:5">116:5</a> The Lord is merciful and fair;
our God is compassionate.

<a name="116:6">116:6</a> The Lord protects the untrained;
I was in serious trouble and he delivered me.

<a name="116:7">116:7</a> Rest once more, my soul,
for the Lord has vindicated you.

<a name="116:8">116:8</a> Yes, Lord, you rescued my life from death,
and kept my feet from stumbling.

<a name="116:9">116:9</a> I will serve the Lord
in the land of the living.

<a name="116:10">116:10</a> I had faith when I said,
“I am severely oppressed.”

<a name="116:11">116:11</a> I rashly declared,
“All men are liars.”

<a name="116:12">116:12</a> How can I repay the Lord
for all his acts of kindness to me?

<a name="116:13">116:13</a> I will celebrate my deliverance,
and call on the name of the Lord.

<a name="116:14">116:14</a> I will fulfill my vows to the Lord
before all his people.

<a name="116:15">116:15</a> The Lord values
the lives of his faithful followers.

<a name="116:16">116:16</a> Yes, Lord! I am indeed your servant;
I am your lowest slave.
You saved me from death.

<a name="116:17">116:17</a> I will present a thank offering to you,
and call on the name of the Lord.

<a name="116:18">116:18</a> I will fulfill my vows to the Lord
before all his people,

<a name="116:19">116:19</a> in the courts of the Lord’s temple,
in your midst, O Jerusalem.
Praise the Lord!
