<a name="115:1">115:1</a> Not to us, O Lord, not to us!
But to your name bring honor,
for the sake of your loyal love and faithfulness.

<a name="115:2">115:2</a> Why should the nations say,
“Where is their God?”

<a name="115:3">115:3</a> Our God is in heaven!
He does whatever he pleases!

<a name="115:4">115:4</a> Their idols are made of silver and gold — 
they are man-made.

<a name="115:5">115:5</a> They have mouths, but cannot speak,
eyes, but cannot see,

<a name="115:6">115:6</a> ears, but cannot hear,
noses, but cannot smell,

<a name="115:7">115:7</a> hands, but cannot touch,
feet, but cannot walk.
They cannot even clear their throats.

<a name="115:8">115:8</a> Those who make them will end up like them,
as will everyone who trusts in them.

<a name="115:9">115:9</a> O Israel, trust in the Lord!
He is their deliverer and protector.

<a name="115:10">115:10</a> O family of Aaron, trust in the Lord!
He is their deliverer and protector.

<a name="115:11">115:11</a> You loyal followers of the Lord, trust in the Lord!
He is their deliverer and protector.

<a name="115:12">115:12</a> The Lord takes notice of us, he will bless — 
he will bless the family of Israel,
he will bless the family of Aaron.

<a name="115:13">115:13</a> He will bless his loyal followers,
both young and old.

<a name="115:14">115:14</a> May he increase your numbers,
yours and your childrens’!

<a name="115:15">115:15</a> May you be blessed by the Lord,
the creator of heaven and earth!

<a name="115:16">115:16</a> The heavens belong to the Lord,
but the earth he has given to mankind.

<a name="115:17">115:17</a> The dead do not praise the Lord,
nor do any of those who descend into the silence of death.

<a name="115:18">115:18</a> But we will praise the Lord
now and forevermore.
Praise the Lord!
