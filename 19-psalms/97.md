<a name="97:1">97:1</a> The Lord reigns!
Let the earth be happy!
Let the many coastlands rejoice!

<a name="97:2">97:2</a> Dark clouds surround him;
equity and justice are the foundation of his throne.

<a name="97:3">97:3</a> Fire goes before him;
on every side it burns up his enemies.

<a name="97:4">97:4</a> His lightning bolts light up the world;
the earth sees and trembles.

<a name="97:5">97:5</a> The mountains melt like wax before the Lord,
before the sovereign Master of the whole earth.

<a name="97:6">97:6</a> The sky declares his justice,
and all the nations see his splendor.

<a name="97:7">97:7</a> All who worship idols are ashamed,
those who boast about worthless idols.
All the gods bow down before him.

<a name="97:8">97:8</a> Zion hears and rejoices,
the towns of Judah are happy,
because of your judgments, O Lord.

<a name="97:9">97:9</a> For you, O Lord, are the sovereign king over the whole earth;
you are elevated high above all gods.

<a name="97:10">97:10</a> You who love the Lord, hate evil!
He protects the lives of his faithful followers;
he delivers them from the power of the wicked.

<a name="97:11">97:11</a> The godly bask in the light;
the morally upright experience joy.

<a name="97:12">97:12</a> You godly ones, rejoice in the Lord!
give thanks to his holy name.
