<a name="114:1">114:1</a> When Israel left Egypt,
when the family of Jacob left a foreign nation behind,

<a name="114:2">114:2</a> Judah became his sanctuary,
Israel his kingdom.

<a name="114:3">114:3</a> The sea looked and fled;
the Jordan River turned back.

<a name="114:4">114:4</a> The mountains skipped like rams,
the hills like lambs.

<a name="114:5">114:5</a> Why do you flee, O sea?
Why do you turn back, O Jordan River?

<a name="114:6">114:6</a> Why do you skip like rams, O mountains,
like lambs, O hills?

<a name="114:7">114:7</a> Tremble, O earth, before the sovereign Master â€” 
before the God of Jacob,

<a name="114:8">114:8</a> who turned a rock into a pool of water,
a hard rock into springs of water!
