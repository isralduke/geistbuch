A song of ascents, by David.


<a name="131:1">131:1</a> O Lord, my heart is not proud,
nor do I have a haughty look.
I do not have great aspirations,
or concern myself with things that are beyond me.

<a name="131:2">131:2</a> Indeed I am composed and quiet,
like a young child carried by its mother;
I am content like the young child I carry.

<a name="131:3">131:3</a> O Israel, hope in the Lord
now and forevermore!
