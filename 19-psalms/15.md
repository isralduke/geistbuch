A psalm of David.

<a name="15:1">15:1</a> Lord, who may be a guest in your home?
Who may live on your holy hill?

<a name="15:2">15:2</a> Whoever lives a blameless life,
does what is right,
and speaks honestly.

<a name="15:3">15:3</a> He does not slander,
or do harm to others,
or insult his neighbor.

<a name="15:4">15:4</a> He despises a reprobate,
but honors the Lordâ€™s loyal followers.
He makes firm commitments and does not renege on his promise.

<a name="15:5">15:5</a> He does not charge interest when he lends his money.
He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
The one who lives like this will never be upended.
