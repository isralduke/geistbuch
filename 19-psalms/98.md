A psalm.


<a name="98:1">98:1</a> Sing to the Lord a new song,
for he performs amazing deeds!
His right hand and his mighty arm
accomplish deliverance.

<a name="98:2">98:2</a> The Lord demonstrates his power to deliver;
in the sight of the nations he reveals his justice.

<a name="98:3">98:3</a> He remains loyal and faithful to the family of Israel.
All the ends of the earth see our God deliver us.

<a name="98:4">98:4</a> Shout out praises to the Lord, all the earth!
Break out in a joyful shout and sing!

<a name="98:5">98:5</a> Sing to the Lord accompanied by a harp,
accompanied by a harp and the sound of music!

<a name="98:6">98:6</a> With trumpets and the blaring of the ramâ€™s horn,
shout out praises before the king, the Lord!

<a name="98:7">98:7</a> Let the sea and everything in it shout,
along with the world and those who live in it!

<a name="98:8">98:8</a> Let the rivers clap their hands!
Let the mountains sing in unison

<a name="98:9">98:9</a> before the Lord!
For he comes to judge the earth!
He judges the world fairly,
and the nations in a just manner.
