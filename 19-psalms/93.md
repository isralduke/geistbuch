<a name="93:1">93:1</a> The Lord reigns!
He is robed in majesty,
the Lord is robed,
he wears strength around his waist.
Indeed, the world is established, it cannot be moved.

<a name="93:2">93:2</a> Your throne has been secure from ancient times;
you have always been king.

<a name="93:3">93:3</a> The waves roar, O Lord,
the waves roar,
the waves roar and crash.

<a name="93:4">93:4</a> Above the sound of the surging water,
and the mighty waves of the sea,
the Lord sits enthroned in majesty.

<a name="93:5">93:5</a> The rules you set down are completely reliable.
Holiness aptly adorns your house, O Lord, forever.
