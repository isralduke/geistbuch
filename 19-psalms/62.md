For the music director, Jeduthun; a psalm of David.


<a name="62:1">62:1</a> For God alone I patiently wait;
he is the one who delivers me.

<a name="62:2">62:2</a> He alone is my protector and deliverer.
He is my refuge; I will not be upended.

<a name="62:3">62:3</a> How long will you threaten a man?
All of you are murderers,
as dangerous as a leaning wall or an unstable fence.

<a name="62:4">62:4</a> They spend all their time planning how to bring him down.
They love to use deceit;
they pronounce blessings with their mouths,
but inwardly they utter curses. (Selah)

<a name="62:5">62:5</a> Patiently wait for God alone, my soul!
For he is the one who gives me confidence.

<a name="62:6">62:6</a> He alone is my protector and deliverer.
He is my refuge; I will not be upended.

<a name="62:7">62:7</a> God delivers me and exalts me;
God is my strong protector and my shelter.

<a name="62:8">62:8</a> Trust in him at all times, you people!
Pour out your hearts before him!
God is our shelter! (Selah)

<a name="62:9">62:9</a> Men are nothing but a mere breath;
human beings are unreliable.
When they are weighed in the scales,
all of them together are lighter than air.

<a name="62:10">62:10</a> Do not trust in what you can gain by oppression!
Do not put false confidence in what you can gain by robbery!
If wealth increases, do not become attached to it!

<a name="62:11">62:11</a> God has declared one principle;
two principles I have heard:
God is strong,

<a name="62:12">62:12</a> and you, O sovereign Master, demonstrate loyal love.
For you repay men for what they do.
