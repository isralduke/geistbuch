For the music director; by the Korahites; according to the alamoth style; a song.


<a name="46:1">46:1</a> God is our secure shelter;
he is truly our helper in times of trouble.

<a name="46:2">46:2</a> For this reason we do not fear when the earth shakes,
and the mountains tumble into the depths of the sea,

<a name="46:3">46:3</a> when its waves crash and foam,
and the mountains shake before the surging sea. (Selah)

<a name="46:4">46:4</a> The irrigation canals flowing from the river bring joy to the city of God,
the special, holy dwelling place of the Sovereign One.

<a name="46:5">46:5</a> God lives within it, it cannot be upended.
God rescues it at the break of dawn.

<a name="46:6">46:6</a> Nations make a commotion, kingdoms are upended.
God gives a battle cry, the earth dissolves.

<a name="46:7">46:7</a> The Lord, the invincible Warrior, is on our side!
The God of Jacob is our protector! (Selah)

<a name="46:8">46:8</a> Come! Witness the exploits of the Lord,
who brings devastation to the earth!

<a name="46:9">46:9</a> He brings an end to wars throughout the earth;
he shatters the bow and breaks the spear;
he burns the shields.

<a name="46:10">46:10</a> He says, “Stop your striving and recognize that I am God!
I will be exalted over the nations! I will be exalted over the earth!”

<a name="46:11">46:11</a> The Lord, the invincible Warrior is on our side!
The God of Jacob is our protector! (Selah)
