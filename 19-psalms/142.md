A well-written song by David, when he was in the cave; a prayer.


<a name="142:1">142:1</a> To the Lord I cry out;
to the Lord I plead for mercy.

<a name="142:2">142:2</a> I pour out my lament before him;
I tell him about my troubles.

<a name="142:3">142:3</a> Even when my strength leaves me,
you watch my footsteps.
In the path where I walk
they have hidden a snare for me.

<a name="142:4">142:4</a> Look to the right and see!
No one cares about me.
I have nowhere to run;
no one is concerned about my life.

<a name="142:5">142:5</a> I cry out to you, O Lord;
I say, “You are my shelter,
my security in the land of the living.”

<a name="142:6">142:6</a> Listen to my cry for help,
for I am in serious trouble!
Rescue me from those who chase me,
for they are stronger than I am.

<a name="142:7">142:7</a> Free me from prison,
that I may give thanks to your name.
Because of me the godly will assemble,
for you will vindicate me.
