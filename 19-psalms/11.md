For the music director; by David.

<a name="11:1">11:1</a> In the Lord I have taken shelter.
How can you say to me,
“Flee to a mountain like a bird!

<a name="11:2">11:2</a> For look, the wicked prepare their bows,
they put their arrows on the strings,
to shoot in the darkness at the morally upright.

<a name="11:3">11:3</a> When the foundations are destroyed,
what can the godly accomplish?”

<a name="11:4">11:4</a> The Lord is in his holy temple;
the Lord’s throne is in heaven.
His eyes watch;
his eyes examine all people.

<a name="11:5">11:5</a> The Lord approves of the godly,
but he hates the wicked and those who love to do violence.

<a name="11:6">11:6</a> May the Lord rain down burning coals and brimstone on the wicked!
A whirlwind is what they deserve!

<a name="11:7">11:7</a> Certainly the Lord is just;
he rewards godly deeds;
the upright will experience his favor.
