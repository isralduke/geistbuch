A song of ascents.


<a name="130:1">130:1</a> From the deep water I cry out to you, O Lord.

<a name="130:2">130:2</a> O sovereign Master, listen to me!
Pay attention to my plea for mercy!

<a name="130:3">130:3</a> If you, O Lord, were to keep track of sins,
O sovereign Master, who could stand before you?

<a name="130:4">130:4</a> But you are willing to forgive,
so that you might be honored.

<a name="130:5">130:5</a> I rely on the Lord,
I rely on him with my whole being;
I wait for his assuring word.

<a name="130:6">130:6</a> I yearn for the sovereign Master,
more than watchmen do for the morning,
yes, more than watchmen do for the morning.

<a name="130:7">130:7</a> O Israel, hope in the Lord,
for the Lord exhibits loyal love,
and is more than willing to deliver.

<a name="130:8">130:8</a> He will deliver Israel
from all the consequences of their sins.
