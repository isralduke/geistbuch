<a name="146:1">146:1</a> Praise the Lord!
Praise the Lord, O my soul!

<a name="146:2">146:2</a> I will praise the Lord as long as I live!
I will sing praises to my God as long as I exist!

<a name="146:3">146:3</a> Do not trust in princes,
or in human beings, who cannot deliver!

<a name="146:4">146:4</a> Their lifeâ€™s breath departs, they return to the ground;
on that day their plans die.

<a name="146:5">146:5</a> How happy is the one whose helper is the God of Jacob,
whose hope is in the Lord his God,

<a name="146:6">146:6</a> the one who made heaven and earth,
the sea, and all that is in them,
who remains forever faithful,

<a name="146:7">146:7</a> vindicates the oppressed,
and gives food to the hungry.
The Lord releases the imprisoned.

<a name="146:8">146:8</a> The Lord gives sight to the blind.
The Lord lifts up all who are bent over.
The Lord loves the godly.

<a name="146:9">146:9</a> The Lord protects those residing outside their native land;
he lifts up the fatherless and the widow,
but he opposes the wicked.

<a name="146:10">146:10</a> The Lord rules forever,
your God, O Zion, throughout the generations to come!
Praise the Lord!
