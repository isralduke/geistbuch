A song of ascents, by Solomon.


<a name="127:1">127:1</a> If the Lord does not build a house,
then those who build it work in vain.
If the Lord does not guard a city,
then the watchman stands guard in vain.

<a name="127:2">127:2</a> It is vain for you to rise early, come home late,
and work so hard for your food.
Yes, he can provide for those whom he loves even when they sleep.

<a name="127:3">127:3</a> Yes, sons are a gift from the Lord,
the fruit of the womb is a reward.

<a name="127:4">127:4</a> Sons born during one’s youth
are like arrows in a warrior’s hand.

<a name="127:5">127:5</a> How happy is the man who fills his quiver with them!
They will not be put to shame when they confront enemies at the city gate.
