For the music director; a psalm of David.


<a name="140:1">140:1</a> O Lord, rescue me from wicked men!
Protect me from violent men,

<a name="140:2">140:2</a> who plan ways to harm me.
All day long they stir up conflict.

<a name="140:3">140:3</a> Their tongues wound like a serpent;
a viper’s venom is behind their lips. (Selah)

<a name="140:4">140:4</a> O Lord, shelter me from the power of the wicked!
Protect me from violent men,
who plan to knock me over.

<a name="140:5">140:5</a> Proud men hide a snare for me;
evil men spread a net by the path;
they set traps for me. (Selah)

<a name="140:6">140:6</a> I say to the Lord, “You are my God.”
O Lord, pay attention to my plea for mercy!

<a name="140:7">140:7</a> O sovereign Lord, my strong deliverer,
you shield my head in the day of battle.

<a name="140:8">140:8</a> O Lord, do not let the wicked have their way!
Do not allow their plan to succeed when they attack! (Selah)

<a name="140:9">140:9</a> As for the heads of those who surround me — 
may the harm done by their lips overwhelm them!

<a name="140:10">140:10</a> May he rain down fiery coals upon them!
May he throw them into the fire!
From bottomless pits they will not escape.

<a name="140:11">140:11</a> A slanderer will not endure on the earth;
calamity will hunt down a violent man and strike him down.

<a name="140:12">140:12</a> I know that the Lord defends the cause of the oppressed
and vindicates the poor.

<a name="140:13">140:13</a> Certainly the godly will give thanks to your name;
the morally upright will live in your presence.
