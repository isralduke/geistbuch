A song of ascents.


<a name="129:1">129:1</a> “Since my youth they have often attacked me,”
let Israel say.

<a name="129:2">129:2</a> “Since my youth they have often attacked me,
but they have not defeated me.

<a name="129:3">129:3</a> The plowers plowed my back;
they made their furrows long.

<a name="129:4">129:4</a> The Lord is just;
he cut the ropes of the wicked.”

<a name="129:5">129:5</a> May all who hate Zion
be humiliated and turned back!

<a name="129:6">129:6</a> May they be like the grass on the rooftops
which withers before one can even pull it up,

<a name="129:7">129:7</a> which cannot fill the reaper’s hand,
or the lap of the one who gathers the grain!

<a name="129:8">129:8</a> Those who pass by will not say,
“May you experience the Lord’s blessing!
We pronounce a blessing on you in the name of the Lord.”
