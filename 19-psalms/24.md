A psalm of David.

<a name="24:1">24:1</a> The Lord owns the earth and all it contains,
the world and all who live in it.

<a name="24:2">24:2</a> For he set its foundation upon the seas,
and established it upon the ocean currents.

<a name="24:3">24:3</a> Who is allowed to ascend the mountain of the Lord?
Who may go up to his holy dwelling place?

<a name="24:4">24:4</a> The one whose deeds are blameless
and whose motives are pure,
who does not lie,
or make promises with no intention of keeping them.

<a name="24:5">24:5</a> Such godly people are rewarded by the Lord,
and vindicated by the God who delivers them.

<a name="24:6">24:6</a> Such purity characterizes the people who seek his favor,
Jacobâ€™s descendants, who pray to him. (Selah)

<a name="24:7">24:7</a> Look up, you gates!
Rise up, you eternal doors!
Then the majestic king will enter!

<a name="24:8">24:8</a> Who is this majestic king?
The Lord who is strong and mighty!
The Lord who is mighty in battle!

<a name="24:9">24:9</a> Look up, you gates!
Rise up, you eternal doors!
Then the majestic king will enter!

<a name="24:10">24:10</a> Who is this majestic king?
The Lord who leads armies!
He is the majestic king! (Selah)
