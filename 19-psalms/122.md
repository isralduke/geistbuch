A song of ascents, by David.


<a name="122:1">122:1</a> I was glad because they said to me,
“We will go to the Lord’s temple.”

<a name="122:2">122:2</a> Our feet are standing
inside your gates, O Jerusalem.

<a name="122:3">122:3</a> Jerusalem is a city designed
to accommodate an assembly.

<a name="122:4">122:4</a> The tribes go up there,
the tribes of the Lord,
where it is required that Israel
give thanks to the name of the Lord.

<a name="122:5">122:5</a> Indeed, the leaders sit there on thrones and make legal decisions,
on the thrones of the house of David.

<a name="122:6">122:6</a> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem!
May those who love her prosper!

<a name="122:7">122:7</a> May there be peace inside your defenses,
and prosperity inside your fortresses!

<a name="122:8">122:8</a> For the sake of my brothers and my neighbors
I will say, “May there be peace in you!”

<a name="122:9">122:9</a> For the sake of the temple of the Lord our God
I will pray for you to prosper.
