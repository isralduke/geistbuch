A song of ascents.


<a name="120:1">120:1</a> In my distress I cried out
to the Lord and he answered me.

<a name="120:2">120:2</a> I said, “O Lord, rescue me
from those who lie with their lips
and those who deceive with their tongue.

<a name="120:3">120:3</a> How will he severely punish you,
you deceptive talker?

<a name="120:4">120:4</a> Here’s how! With the sharp arrows of warriors,
with arrowheads forged over the hot coals.

<a name="120:5">120:5</a> How miserable I am!
For I have lived temporarily in Meshech;
I have resided among the tents of Kedar.

<a name="120:6">120:6</a> For too long I have had to reside
with those who hate peace.

<a name="120:7">120:7</a> I am committed to peace,
but when I speak, they want to make war.
