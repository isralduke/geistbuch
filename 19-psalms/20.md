For the music director; a psalm of David.

<a name="20:1">20:1</a> May the Lord answer you when you are in trouble;
may the God of Jacob make you secure!

<a name="20:2">20:2</a> May he send you help from his temple;
from Zion may he give you support!

<a name="20:3">20:3</a> May he take notice of your offerings;
may he accept your burnt sacrifice! (Selah)

<a name="20:4">20:4</a> May he grant your heartâ€™s desire;
may he bring all your plans to pass!

<a name="20:5">20:5</a> Then we will shout for joy over your victory;
we will rejoice in the name of our God!
May the Lord grant all your requests!

<a name="20:6">20:6</a> Now I am sure that the Lord will deliver his chosen king;
he will intervene for him from his holy heavenly temple,
and display his mighty ability to deliver.

<a name="20:7">20:7</a> Some trust in chariots and others in horses,
but we depend on the Lord our God.

<a name="20:8">20:8</a> They will fall down,
but we will stand firm.

<a name="20:9">20:9</a> The Lord will deliver the king;
he will answer us when we call to him for help!
