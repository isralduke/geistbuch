<a name="99:1">99:1</a> The Lord reigns!
The nations tremble.
He sits enthroned above the winged angels;
the earth shakes.

<a name="99:2">99:2</a> The Lord is elevated in Zion;
he is exalted over all the nations.

<a name="99:3">99:3</a> Let them praise your great and awesome name!
He is holy!

<a name="99:4">99:4</a> The king is strong;
he loves justice.
You ensure that legal decisions will be made fairly;
you promote justice and equity in Jacob.

<a name="99:5">99:5</a> Praise the Lord our God!
Worship before his footstool!
He is holy!

<a name="99:6">99:6</a> Moses and Aaron were among his priests;
Samuel was one of those who prayed to him.
They prayed to the Lord and he answered them.

<a name="99:7">99:7</a> He spoke to them from a pillar of cloud;
they obeyed his regulations and the ordinance he gave them.

<a name="99:8">99:8</a> O Lord our God, you answered them.
They found you to be a forgiving God,
but also one who punished their sinful deeds.

<a name="99:9">99:9</a> Praise the Lord our God!
Worship on his holy hill,
for the Lord our God is holy!
