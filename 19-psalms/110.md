A psalm of David.


<a name="110:1">110:1</a> Here is the Lord’s proclamation to my lord:
“Sit down at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool!”

<a name="110:2">110:2</a> The Lord extends your dominion from Zion.
Rule in the midst of your enemies!

<a name="110:3">110:3</a> Your people willingly follow you when you go into battle.
On the holy hills at sunrise the dew of your youth belongs to you.

<a name="110:4">110:4</a> The Lord makes this promise on oath and will not revoke it:
“You are an eternal priest after the pattern of Melchizedek.”

<a name="110:5">110:5</a> O sovereign Lord, at your right hand
he strikes down kings in the day he unleashes his anger.

<a name="110:6">110:6</a> He executes judgment against the nations;
he fills the valleys with corpses;
he shatters their heads over the vast battlefield.

<a name="110:7">110:7</a> From the stream along the road he drinks;
then he lifts up his head.
