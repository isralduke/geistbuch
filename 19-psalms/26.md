By David.

<a name="26:1">26:1</a> Vindicate me, O Lord,
for I have integrity,
and I trust in the Lord without wavering.

<a name="26:2">26:2</a> Examine me, O Lord, and test me!
Evaluate my inner thoughts and motives!

<a name="26:3">26:3</a> For I am ever aware of your faithfulness,
and your loyalty continually motivates me.

<a name="26:4">26:4</a> I do not associate with deceitful men,
or consort with those who are dishonest.

<a name="26:5">26:5</a> I hate the mob of evil men,
and do not associate with the wicked.

<a name="26:6">26:6</a> I maintain a pure lifestyle,
so I can appear before your altar, O Lord,

<a name="26:7">26:7</a> to give you thanks,
and to tell about all your amazing deeds.

<a name="26:8">26:8</a> O Lord, I love the temple where you live,
the place where your splendor is revealed.

<a name="26:9">26:9</a> Do not sweep me away with sinners,
or execute me along with violent people,

<a name="26:10">26:10</a> who are always ready to do wrong
or offer a bribe.

<a name="26:11">26:11</a> But I have integrity!
Rescue me and have mercy on me!

<a name="26:12">26:12</a> I am safe,
and among the worshipers I will praise the Lord.
