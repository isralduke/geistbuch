For the music director; a well-written song by David. It was written when Doeg the Edomite went and informed Saul: “David has arrived at the home of Ahimelech.”


<a name="52:1">52:1</a> Why do you boast about your evil plans, O powerful man?
God’s loyal love protects me all day long!

<a name="52:2">52:2</a> Your tongue carries out your destructive plans;
it is as effective as a sharp razor, O deceiver.

<a name="52:3">52:3</a> You love evil more than good,
lies more than speaking the truth. (Selah)

<a name="52:4">52:4</a> You love to use all the words that destroy,
and the tongue that deceives.

<a name="52:5">52:5</a> Yet God will make you a permanent heap of ruins.
He will scoop you up and remove you from your home;
he will uproot you from the land of the living. (Selah)

<a name="52:6">52:6</a> When the godly see this, they will be filled with awe,
and will mock the evildoer, saying:

<a name="52:7">52:7</a> “Look, here is the man who would not make God his protector!
He trusted in his great wealth
and was confident about his plans to destroy others.”

<a name="52:8">52:8</a> But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God;
I continually trust in God’s loyal love.

<a name="52:9">52:9</a> I will continually thank you when you execute judgment;
I will rely on you, for your loyal followers know you are good.
