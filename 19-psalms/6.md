For the music director, to be accompanied by stringed instruments, according to the sheminith style; a psalm of David.

<a name="6:1">6:1</a> Lord, do not rebuke me in your anger!
Do not punish me in your raging fury!

<a name="6:2">6:2</a> Have mercy on me, Lord, for I am frail!
Heal me, Lord, for my bones are shaking!

<a name="6:3">6:3</a> I am absolutely terrified,
and you, Lord â€” how long will this go on?

<a name="6:4">6:4</a> Come back, Lord, rescue me!
Deliver me because of your faithfulness!

<a name="6:5">6:5</a> For no one mentions your name in the realm of death,
In Sheol who gives you thanks?

<a name="6:6">6:6</a> I am exhausted as I groan;
all night long I drench my bed in tears;
my tears saturate the cushion beneath me.

<a name="6:7">6:7</a> My eyes grow dim from suffering;
they grow weak because of all my enemies.

<a name="6:8">6:8</a> Turn back from me, all you who behave wickedly,
for the Lord has heard the sound of my weeping!

<a name="6:9">6:9</a> The Lord has heard my appeal for mercy;
the Lord has accepted my prayer.

<a name="6:10">6:10</a> May all my enemies be humiliated and absolutely terrified!
May they turn back and be suddenly humiliated!
