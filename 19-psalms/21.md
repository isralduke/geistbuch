For the music director; a psalm of David.

<a name="21:1">21:1</a> O Lord, the king rejoices in the strength you give;
he takes great delight in the deliverance you provide.

<a name="21:2">21:2</a> You grant him his heart’s desire;
you do not refuse his request. (Selah)

<a name="21:3">21:3</a> For you bring him rich blessings;
you place a golden crown on his head.

<a name="21:4">21:4</a> He asked you to sustain his life,
and you have granted him long life and an enduring dynasty.

<a name="21:5">21:5</a> Your deliverance brings him great honor;
you give him majestic splendor.

<a name="21:6">21:6</a> For you grant him lasting blessings;
you give him great joy by allowing him into your presence.

<a name="21:7">21:7</a> For the king trusts in the Lord,
and because of the Sovereign Lord’s faithfulness he is not upended.

<a name="21:8">21:8</a> You prevail over all your enemies;
your power is too great for those who hate you.

<a name="21:9">21:9</a> You burn them up like a fiery furnace when you appear;
the Lord angrily devours them;
the fire consumes them.

<a name="21:10">21:10</a> You destroy their offspring from the earth,
their descendants from among the human race.

<a name="21:11">21:11</a> Yes, they intend to do you harm;
they dream up a scheme, but they do not succeed.

<a name="21:12">21:12</a> For you make them retreat
when you shoot your arrows at them.

<a name="21:13">21:13</a> Rise up, O Lord, in strength!
We will sing and praise your power!
