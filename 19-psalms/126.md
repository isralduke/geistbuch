A song of ascents.


<a name="126:1">126:1</a> When the Lord restored the well-being of Zion,
we thought we were dreaming.

<a name="126:2">126:2</a> At that time we laughed loudly
and shouted for joy.
At that time the nations said,
“The Lord has accomplished great things for these people.”

<a name="126:3">126:3</a> The Lord did indeed accomplish great things for us.
We were happy.

<a name="126:4">126:4</a> O Lord, restore our well-being,
just as the streams in the arid south are replenished.

<a name="126:5">126:5</a> Those who shed tears as they plant
will shout for joy when they reap the harvest.

<a name="126:6">126:6</a> The one who weeps as he walks along, carrying his bag of seed,
will certainly come in with a shout of joy, carrying his sheaves of grain.
