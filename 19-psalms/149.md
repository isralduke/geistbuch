<a name="149:1">149:1</a> Praise the Lord!
Sing to the Lord a new song!
Praise him in the assembly of the godly!

<a name="149:2">149:2</a> Let Israel rejoice in their Creator!
Let the people of Zion delight in their king!

<a name="149:3">149:3</a> Let them praise his name with dancing!
Let them sing praises to him to the accompaniment of the tambourine and harp!

<a name="149:4">149:4</a> For the Lord takes delight in his people;
he exalts the oppressed by delivering them.

<a name="149:5">149:5</a> Let the godly rejoice because of their vindication!
Let them shout for joy upon their beds!

<a name="149:6">149:6</a> May they praise God
while they hold a two-edged sword in their hand,

<a name="149:7">149:7</a> in order to take revenge on the nations,
and punish foreigners.

<a name="149:8">149:8</a> They bind their kings in chains,
and their nobles in iron shackles,

<a name="149:9">149:9</a> and execute the judgment to which their enemies have been sentenced.
All his loyal followers will be vindicated.
Praise the Lord!
