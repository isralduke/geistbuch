For the music director; a psalm of David.


<a name="64:1">64:1</a> Listen to me, O God, as I offer my lament!
Protect my life from the enemy’s terrifying attacks.

<a name="64:2">64:2</a> Hide me from the plots of evil men,
from the crowd of evildoers.

<a name="64:3">64:3</a> They sharpen their tongues like a sword;
they aim their arrow, a slanderous charge,

<a name="64:4">64:4</a> in order to shoot down the innocent in secluded places.
They shoot at him suddenly and are unafraid of retaliation.

<a name="64:5">64:5</a> They encourage one another to carry out their evil deed.
They plan how to hide snares,
and boast, “Who will see them?”

<a name="64:6">64:6</a> They devise unjust schemes;
they disguise a well-conceived plot.
Man’s inner thoughts cannot be discovered.

<a name="64:7">64:7</a> But God will shoot at them;
suddenly they will be wounded by an arrow.

<a name="64:8">64:8</a> Their slander will bring about their demise.
All who see them will shudder,

<a name="64:9">64:9</a> and all people will fear.
They will proclaim what God has done,
and reflect on his deeds.

<a name="64:10">64:10</a> The godly will rejoice in the Lord
and take shelter in him.
All the morally upright will boast.
