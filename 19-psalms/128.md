A song of ascents.


<a name="128:1">128:1</a> How happy is every one of the Lordâ€™s loyal followers,
each one who keeps his commands!

<a name="128:2">128:2</a> You will eat what you worked so hard to grow.
You will be happy and secure.

<a name="128:3">128:3</a> Your wife will be like a fruitful vine
in the inner rooms of your house;
your children will be like olive branches,
as they sit all around your table.

<a name="128:4">128:4</a> Yes indeed, the man who fears the Lord
will be blessed in this way.

<a name="128:5">128:5</a> May the Lord bless you from Zion,
that you might see Jerusalem prosper
all the days of your life,

<a name="128:6">128:6</a> and that you might see your grandchildren.
May Israel experience peace!
