A psalm of David.

<a name="23:1">23:1</a> The Lord is my shepherd,
I lack nothing.

<a name="23:2">23:2</a> He takes me to lush pastures,
he leads me to refreshing water.

<a name="23:3">23:3</a> He restores my strength.
He leads me down the right paths
for the sake of his reputation.

<a name="23:4">23:4</a> Even when I must walk through a dark ravine,
I fear no danger,
for you are with me;
your rod and your staff keep me calm.

<a name="23:5">23:5</a> You prepare a feast before me
in plain sight of my enemies.
You refresh my head with oil;
my cup is full of wine.

<a name="23:6">23:6</a> Surely your goodness and faithfulness will pursue me all the days of my life,
and I will live in the Lordâ€™s palace for the rest of my life.
