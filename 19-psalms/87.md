Written by the Korahites; a psalm, a song.

<a name="87:1">87:1</a> The Lord’s city is in the holy hills.

<a name="87:2">87:2</a> The Lord loves the gates of Zion
more than all the dwelling places of Jacob.

<a name="87:3">87:3</a> People say wonderful things about you,
O city of God. (Selah)

<a name="87:4">87:4</a> I mention Rahab and Babylon to my followers.
Here are Philistia and Tyre, along with Ethiopia.
It is said of them, “This one was born there.”

<a name="87:5">87:5</a> But it is said of Zion’s residents,
“Each one of these was born in her,
and the Sovereign One makes her secure.”

<a name="87:6">87:6</a> The Lord writes in the census book of the nations,
“This one was born there.” (Selah)

<a name="87:7">87:7</a> As for the singers, as well as the pipers — 
all of them sing within your walls.
