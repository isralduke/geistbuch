<a name="137:1">137:1</a> By the rivers of Babylon
we sit down and weep
when we remember Zion.

<a name="137:2">137:2</a> On the poplars in her midst
we hang our harps,

<a name="137:3">137:3</a> for there our captors ask us to compose songs;
those who mock us demand that we be happy, saying:
“Sing for us a song about Zion!”

<a name="137:4">137:4</a> How can we sing a song to the Lord
in a foreign land?

<a name="137:5">137:5</a> If I forget you, O Jerusalem,
may my right hand be crippled!

<a name="137:6">137:6</a> May my tongue stick to the roof of my mouth,
if I do not remember you,
and do not give Jerusalem priority
over whatever gives me the most joy.

<a name="137:7">137:7</a> Remember, O Lord, what the Edomites did
on the day Jerusalem fell.
They said, “Tear it down, tear it down,
right to its very foundation!”

<a name="137:8">137:8</a> O daughter Babylon, soon to be devastated!
How happy will be the one who repays you
for what you dished out to us!

<a name="137:9">137:9</a> How happy will be the one who grabs your babies
and smashes them on a rock!
