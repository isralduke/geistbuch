A psalm of David, written when he fled from his son Absalom.

<a name="3:1">3:1</a> Lord, how numerous are my enemies!
Many attack me.

<a name="3:2">3:2</a> Many say about me,
“God will not deliver him.” (Selah)

<a name="3:3">3:3</a> But you, Lord, are a shield that protects me;
you grant me honor and give me renewed strength.

<a name="3:4">3:4</a> To the Lord I cried out,
and he answered me from his holy hill. (Selah)

<a name="3:5">3:5</a> I rested and slept;
I awoke, for the Lord protects me.

<a name="3:6">3:6</a> I am not afraid of the multitude of people
who attack me from all directions.

<a name="3:7">3:7</a> Rise up, Lord!
Deliver me, my God!
Yes, you will strike all my enemies on the jaw;
you will break the teeth of the wicked.

<a name="3:8">3:8</a> The Lord delivers;
you show favor to your people. (Selah)
