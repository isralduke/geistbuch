<a name="47:1">47:1</a> All you nations, clap your hands!
Shout out to God in celebration!

<a name="47:2">47:2</a> For the sovereign Lord is awe-inspiring;
he is the great king who rules the whole earth!

<a name="47:3">47:3</a> He subdued nations beneath us
and countries under our feet.

<a name="47:4">47:4</a> He picked out for us a special land
to be a source of pride for Jacob, whom he loves. (Selah)

<a name="47:5">47:5</a> God has ascended his throne amid loud shouts;
the Lord has ascended his throne amid the blaring of ramâ€™s horns.

<a name="47:6">47:6</a> Sing to God! Sing!
Sing to our king! Sing!

<a name="47:7">47:7</a> For God is king of the whole earth!
Sing a well-written song!

<a name="47:8">47:8</a> God reigns over the nations!
God sits on his holy throne!

<a name="47:9">47:9</a> The nobles of the nations assemble,
along with the people of the God of Abraham,
for God has authority over the rulers of the earth.
He is highly exalted!
