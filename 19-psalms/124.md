A song of ascents, by David.


<a name="124:1">124:1</a> “If the Lord had not been on our side” — 
let Israel say this! — 

<a name="124:2">124:2</a> if the Lord had not been on our side,
when men attacked us,

<a name="124:3">124:3</a> they would have swallowed us alive,
when their anger raged against us.

<a name="124:4">124:4</a> The water would have overpowered us;
the current would have overwhelmed us.

<a name="124:5">124:5</a> The raging water
would have overwhelmed us.

<a name="124:6">124:6</a> The Lord deserves praise,
for he did not hand us over as prey to their teeth.

<a name="124:7">124:7</a> We escaped with our lives, like a bird from a hunter’s snare.
The snare broke, and we escaped.

<a name="124:8">124:8</a> Our deliverer is the Lord,
the Creator of heaven and earth.
