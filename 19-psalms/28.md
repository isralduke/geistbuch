By David.

<a name="28:1">28:1</a> To you, O Lord, I cry out!
My protector, do not ignore me!
If you do not respond to me,
I will join those who are descending into the grave.

<a name="28:2">28:2</a> Hear my plea for mercy when I cry out to you for help,
when I lift my hands toward your holy temple!

<a name="28:3">28:3</a> Do not drag me away with evil men,
with those who behave wickedly,
who talk so friendly to their neighbors,
while they plan to harm them!

<a name="28:4">28:4</a> Pay them back for their evil deeds!
Pay them back for what they do!
Punish them!

<a name="28:5">28:5</a> For they do not understand the Lordâ€™s actions,
or the way he carries out justice.
The Lord will permanently demolish them.

<a name="28:6">28:6</a> The Lord deserves praise,
for he has heard my plea for mercy!

<a name="28:7">28:7</a> The Lord strengthens and protects me;
I trust in him with all my heart.
I am rescued and my heart is full of joy;
I will sing to him in gratitude.

<a name="28:8">28:8</a> The Lord strengthens his people;
he protects and delivers his chosen king.

<a name="28:9">28:9</a> Deliver your people!
Empower the nation that belongs to you!
Care for them like a shepherd and carry them in your arms at all times!
