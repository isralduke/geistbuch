<a name="2:1">2:1</a> Why do the nations cause a commotion?
Why are the countries devising plots that will fail?

<a name="2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth form a united front;
the rulers collaborate
against the Lord and his chosen king.

<a name="2:3">2:3</a> They say, “Let’s tear off the shackles they’ve put on us!
Let’s free ourselves from their ropes!”

<a name="2:4">2:4</a> The one enthroned in heaven laughs in disgust;
the sovereign Master taunts them.

<a name="2:5">2:5</a> Then he angrily speaks to them
and terrifies them in his rage.

<a name="2:6">2:6</a> He says, “I myself have installed my king
on Zion, my holy hill.”

<a name="2:7">2:7</a> The king says, “I will tell you what the Lord decreed. He said to me:
‘You are my son! This very day I have become your father!

<a name="2:8">2:8</a> You have only to ask me,
and I will give you the nations as your inheritance,
the ends of the earth as your personal property.

<a name="2:9">2:9</a> You will break them with an iron scepter;
you will smash them as if they were a potter’s jar.’”

<a name="2:10">2:10</a> So now, you kings, do what is wise!
You rulers of the earth, submit to correction!

<a name="2:11">2:11</a> Serve the Lord in fear!
Repent in terror!

<a name="2:12">2:12</a> Give sincere homage!
Otherwise he will be angry,
and you will die because of your behavior,
when his anger quickly ignites.
How happy are all who take shelter in him!
