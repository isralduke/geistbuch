<a name="113:1">113:1</a> Praise the Lord!
Praise, you servants of the Lord,
praise the name of the Lord!

<a name="113:2">113:2</a> May the Lord’s name be praised
now and forevermore!

<a name="113:3">113:3</a> From east to west
the Lord’s name is deserving of praise.

<a name="113:4">113:4</a> The Lord is exalted over all the nations;
his splendor reaches beyond the sky.

<a name="113:5">113:5</a> Who can compare to the Lord our God,
who sits on a high throne?

<a name="113:6">113:6</a> He bends down to look
at the sky and the earth.

<a name="113:7">113:7</a> He raises the poor from the dirt,
and lifts up the needy from the garbage pile,

<a name="113:8">113:8</a> that he might seat him with princes,
with the princes of his people.

<a name="113:9">113:9</a> He makes the barren woman of the family
a happy mother of children.
Praise the Lord!
